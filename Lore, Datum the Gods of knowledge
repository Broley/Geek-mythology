Lore son of Megalo, half brother to Datum, born at the beginning of human wisdom was unlike his brother Datum. Lore felt human emotion 
enherited from his mother Trepidatia. Lore became emotionally unstable and developed his fathers megalomaniac tendencies. Lore preceived 
himself superior to Datum and resented him due to the human drive for compileing more data and the tendency to loath the process of
learning. For Datum is the God of retaining human knowlage and Lore is the God of human knowlage gained through study or experience.
